# USGS Orthomosaic Imagery


## Sandwich

### 1. water
Ocean, lakes, rivers, lagoons, estuaries, creeks, inlets, etc

### 2. whitewater
This is breaking and broken waves in the surf and swash of open-coast environments, and also whitewater in rivers.

### 3. sand

### 4. gravel

### 5. cobble and boulder

### 6. vegetated_surface
Any natural surface that is significantly vegetated, by any type of vegetation.

### 7. development
Roads, buildings, paved areas such as parking lots, but not parks, golf courses, etc ; they are 'other natural terrain'

### 8. snow and ice
Portions of the scene that are blank / unreconstructed

### 9. nodata
Portions of the scene that are blank / unreconstructed

### 10. unusual
Genuine cases for where it is possible to tell what it is, but it is a category not listed. This is usually an 'unusual' thing in the scene. For example, a boat at sea, or an algal bloom, etc. These portions of the imagery will be reclassified later.

### 11. unknown
Genuine cases where it is impossible to tell, from texture/color and spatial context. Use sparingly
