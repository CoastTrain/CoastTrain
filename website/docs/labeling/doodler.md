# Doodler

We achieve a fully reproducible workflow by using a semi-interactive ML program called ‘Doodler’ that uses sparse annotations contributed by human labeler to estimate classes for all pixels. Each label image may be reconstructed using the sparse annotations provided by a human annotator, and further, those annotations might be repurposed using a different algorithm, if necessary. 

To get started with Doodler, go to the [Doodler website](https://dbuscombe-usgs.github.io/dash_doodler/) and read the [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EA002085)

The code is found on [github](https://github.com/Doodleverse/dash_doodler). There is also an [official USGS software release](https://code.usgs.gov/pcmsc/dash_doodler) for Doodler.
